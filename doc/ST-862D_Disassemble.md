# Disassemble
## Table of contents

## Important
Before you remove anything from your soldering station, make sure it matches exactly what is in this documentation, or take your own pictures so you can be sure you can reattach it.

## What you need
- Screwdriver (PH2)
- Wrench (7mm)

## How to disassemble it
### 1 Open case
#### 1.1 Unplug the power cord
First, ***disconnect the power cord from the rear panel***. Otherwise there is danger to life due to the high-voltage parts inside the housing.
#### 1.2 Remove screws
Remove the marked screws (4xPH2) on the left and (4xPH2) on the right side. I recommend starting with the top ones as it relieves some tension.
#### 1.3 Remove panel
When all (8xPH2) screws are removed, the case should slide up easily.

### 2 Remove the front panel
#### 2.1 Unplug the power cord
The next step is very dangerous if you haven't unplugged the power cord. The cables carry high voltage even when the front panel power switch is off.
#### 2.2 Unplug the power switch
Remove the 4 connectors on the power button by pulling them one by one. Do not disconnect the other cables yet.
#### 2.3 Remove screws
Remove the marked screws (2xPH2) on the inside of the front panel. Also remove the marked screws (3xPH2) on the bottom of the device. Now the faceplate should be loose, but don't pull it out.
#### 2.4 Remove the hose
To remove the hose you need to cut the marked zip ties. Then you can pull on the pipe and puncture the fan in the process.
#### 2.5 Unplug connector
To disconnect the other connectors, you must first remove the glue from those connectors so you can pull them off without damaging the connector. Because of this, the front panel must be detached to allow access to the glue on the bottom connectors. Not all connections have to be removed, only the marked connections have to be removed.
#### 2.6 Disconnect grounding
Loosen the marked nut on the bottom of the case to expose the ground connection to the handle.
#### 2.7 Remove panel
All connections should now be loose and you can move the front panel away from the case.

### 3 Remove mainboard
#### 3.1 Unplug connector
If you haven't already done so, remove the glue from the remaining connectors on the board so you can unplug them.
#### 3.2 Remove screws
Only remove the marked screws (4xPH2).
#### 3.3 Remove mainboard
Now you can lift the mainboard with the display attached at the back.
